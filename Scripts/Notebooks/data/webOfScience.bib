Abstract = {Fog computing aims to provide the solution of bandwidth, network latency
   and energy consumption problems of cloud computing. Likewise, management
   of data generated by healthcare IoT devices is one of the significant
   applications of fog computing. Huge amount of data is being generated by
   healthcare IoT devices and such types of data is required to be managed
   efficiently, with low latency, without failure, and with minimum energy
   consumption and low cost. Failures of task or node can cause more
   latency, maximum energy consumption and high cost. Thus, a failure free,
   cost efficient, and energy aware management and scheduling scheme for
   data generated by healthcare IoT devices not only improves the
   performance of the system but also saves the precious lives of patients
   because of due to minimum latency and provision of fault tolerance.
   Therefore, to address all such challenges with regard to data management
   and fault tolerance, we have presented a Fault Tolerant Data management
   (FTDM) scheme for healthcare IoT in fog computing. In FTDM, the data
   generated by healthcare IoT devices is efficiently organized and managed
   through well-defined components and steps. A two way fault-tolerant
   mechanism i.e., task-based fault-tolerance and node-based
   fault-tolerance, is provided in FTDM through which failure of tasks and
   nodes are managed. The paper considers energy consumption, execution
   cost, network usage, latency, and execution time as performance
   evaluation parameters. The simulation results show significantly
   improvements which are performed using iFogSim. Further, the simulation
   results show that the proposed FTDM strategy reduces energy consumption
   3.97\%, execution cost 5.09\%, network usage 25.88\%, latency 44.15\%
   and execution time 48.89\% as compared with existing Greedy Knapsack
   Scheduling (GKS) strategy. Moreover, it is worthwhile to mention that
   sometimes the patients are required to be treated remotely due to
   non-availability of facilities or due to some infectious diseases such
   as COVID-19. Thus, in such circumstances, the proposed strategy is
   significantly efficient.},

Title = {Fog computing security: A review},
Journal = {SECURITY AND PRIVACY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 22},
Abstract = {Fog computing, also known as edge computing, is a decentralized
   computing architecture that brings computing and data storage closer to
   the users and devices that need it. It offers several advantages over
   traditional cloud computing, such as lower latency, improved
   reliability, and enhanced security. As the Internet of Things continues
   to grow, the demand for fog computing is also increasing, making it an
   important topic for research and development. However, the deployment of
   fog computing also brings new technical challenges and security risks.
   For example, fog nodes are often deployed in resource-constrained
   environments and are exposed to potential security threats, such as
   malware and attacks on devices connected to the network. In addition,
   the decentralized nature of fog computing creates new challenges in
   terms of privacy, security, and data management. This survey aims to
   address these technical challenges and research gaps in the field of fog
   computing security. It provides an overview of the current state of fog
   computing and its security challenges, and identifies key areas for
   future research. The survey also highlights the importance of fog
   computing security and the need for continued investment in this area in
   order to fully realize the potential of this promising technology.},

Abstract = {Recently, we are witnessing an enormous burst of data due to the
   ever-increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The
   traditional cloud computing paradigm has failed to scale; to be
   specific, its latency and bandwidth utilization are remarkably increased
   and consequently, Quality of Service (QoS) is decreased. On the other
   hand, the data management scope in fog computing require much more
   considerations in terms of performance and scalability. This is because
   of deploying IoT applications over fog nodes considering their
   resource-limited and heterogeneity. However, to the best of our
   knowledge, there is not any literature review that systematically
   categorizes these issues. In this paper, we have presented a
   classification of data replica placement approaches considering four
   main categories: framework-based, graph-based, heuristic-based, and
   meta-heuristic-based algorithms. To sum up, the primary contribution of
   this study is as follows: studying articles on data replica placement in
   fog computing, as well as presenting their strengths and weaknesses,
   providing a comprehensive systematic review of current approaches and
   categorizing them comprehensively, discussing research challenges, and
   future works to improve computing and evaluation mechanisms in the fog
   computing environment. This paper generally provides a classification,
   briefly explains the reviewed techniques, and then compares these
   methods in the end.},

Abstract = {The tremendous increase in IoT devices and the amount of data they
   produced is very expensive to be processed at cloud data centers.
   Therefore, fog computing was introduced in 2012 by Cisco as a
   decentralized computing environment that is considered to be more
   efficient in handling such a plethora in the number of requests. Fog
   computing is a distributed computing paradigm that focuses on bringing
   data processing at the network peripheral to reduce response time and
   increase the quality of service. Dependability challenges of such
   distributed and heterogeneous computing environments are considered in
   this paper. Because fog computing is a new computing paradigm, several
   studies have been presented to tackle its challenges and issues.
   However, dependability in specific did not receive much attention. In
   the paper, we explore several solutions to increase dependability in fog
   computing such as fault tolerance techniques, placement policies,
   middleware, and data management mechanisms aiming to help system
   designers choose the most appropriate solution. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Journal = {COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {178},
Pages = {221-233},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Fog computing, a term coined by Cisco, is a new paradigm that extends
   the capabilities and services of cloud computing to the edge of the
   network. As a result, fog computing provides better location awareness
   and reduces the latency that occurs due to the distance between end
   devices and the cloud, which is a major issue for sensitive
   applications. Given that fog computing runs software on devices at the
   edge of the network rather than on the cloud side, it supports real-time
   smart applications, such as smart homes, smart grids, health data
   management, and smart vehicular technologies. This study focuses on
   security and privacy challenges in the fog computing paradigm and
   proposes a trust mechanism to address data breach, data loss, and denial
   of service (DoS) and establish a secure environment for fog
   applications. The novel model based on the subjective logic method
   calculates the trust value of nodes to determine if a node is a
   legitimate node or a rogue node. The proposed trust model is implemented
   on iFogSim simulator and analyzed with multiple fog nodes, which clearly
   demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed model in providing effective
   security.},

Abstract = {Currently, technology greatly benefits the area of healthcare. Modern
   computers can quickly process a large volume of patient health records.
   Due to recent advances in the area of Internet of Things and healthcare,
   patient data can be dispersed in multiple locations. As a result,
   scientists have been proposing solutions based on Cloud Computing to
   manage healthcare data. However, suchs solutions present challenges
   regarding access latency, context-awareness, and large volumes of data.
   There is an increased probability of processing and transmission errors
   are more likely to occur as health data sets become larger and more
   complex. In this context, Fog Computing presents itself as an
   alternative to reduce health data management complexity, consequently
   increasing its reliability. To that end, it is important to comprehend
   the associated challenges before defining a Fog Computing-based
   architecture to manage healthcare data. This article presents a
   systematic literature review of fog computing being applied to
   healthcare area. We propose a taxonomy to explore the open issues and
   most important challenges on these fields of study. We selected 1070
   scientific articles published in the last 10 years, filtering the 44
   most significant works for an in-depth analysis. We found that there is
   several challenges to be addressed such as interoperability, privacy,
   security, data processing, management of resources and Big Data issues.
   Also, our contribution include developing a taxonomy for the Fog
   Computing and healthcare fields of study and finding out challenges and
   open questions of this area.},

Title = {Fog Computing for Smart Cities' Big Data Management and Analytics: A
   Review},
Journal = {FUTURE INTERNET},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Demographic growth in urban areas means that modern cities face
   challenges in ensuring a steady supply of water and electricity, smart
   transport, livable space, better health services, and citizens' safety.
   Advances in sensing, communication, and digital technologies promise to
   mitigate these challenges. Hence, many smart cities have taken a new
   step in moving away from internal information technology (IT)
   infrastructure to utility-supplied IT delivered over the Internet. The
   benefit of this move is to manage the vast amounts of data generated by
   the various city systems, including water and electricity systems, the
   waste management system, transportation system, public space management
   systems, health and education systems, and many more. Furthermore, many
   smart city applications are time-sensitive and need to quickly analyze
   data to react promptly to the various events occurring in a city. The
   new and emerging paradigms of edge and fog computing promise to address
   big data storage and analysis in the field of smart cities. Here, we
   review existing service delivery models in smart cities and present our
   perspective on adopting these two emerging paradigms. We specifically
   describe the design of a fog-based data pipeline to address the issues
   of latency and network bandwidth required by time-sensitive smart city
   applications.},

Title = {Genetic-based optimization in fog computing: Current trends and research
   opportunities},
Journal = {SWARM AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {72},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Fog computing is a new computational paradigm that emerged from the need
   to reduce network usage and la-tency in the Internet of Things (IoT).
   Fog can be considered as a continuum between the cloud layer and IoT
   users that allows the execution of applications or storage/processing of
   data in network infrastructure devices. The het-erogeneity and wider
   distribution of fog devices are the key differences between cloud and
   fog infrastructure. Genetic-based optimization is commonly used in
   distributed systems; however, the differentiating features of fog
   computing require new designs, studies, and experimentation. The growing
   research in the field of genetic-based fog resource optimization and the
   lack of previous analysis in this field have encouraged us to present a
   compre-hensive, exhaustive, and systematic review of the most recent
   research works. Resource optimization techniques in fog were examined
   and analyzed, with special emphasis on genetic-based solutions and their
   characteristics and design alternatives. We defined a taxonomy of the
   optimization scope in fog infrastructures and used this optimization
   taxonomy to classify the 70 papers in this survey. Subsequently, the
   papers were assessed in terms of genetic optimization design. Finally,
   the benefits and limitations of each surveyed work are outlined in this
   paper. Based on these previous analyses of the relevant literature,
   future research directions were identified. We concluded that more
   research efforts are needed to address the current challenges in data
   management, work-flow scheduling, and service placement. Additionally,
   there is still room for improved designs and deployments of parallel and
   hybrid genetic algorithms that leverage, and adapt to, the heterogeneity
   and distributed features of fog domains.},

Title = {A replication and migration strategy on the hierarchical architecture in
   the fog computing environment},
Journal = {MULTIAGENT AND GRID SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {291-307},
Abstract = {Connecting objects have increasingly become popular in recent years,
   leading to the connection of more than 50 billion objects by the end of
   2020. This large number of objects will generate a huge amount of data
   that is currently being processed and stored in the cloud. Fog Computing
   presents a promising solution to the problems of high latency and huge
   network traffic encountered in the cloud. As Fog's infrastructures are
   dense, heterogeneous and geo-distributed, managing the data in order to
   satisfy users demand in such context is very complicated. In this work,
   we propose a data management strategy called `RMS-HaFC' in which we
   consider the characteristics of Fog Computing environment. To do so, we
   proposed a hierarchical multi-layer model, on which we designed a
   migration and replication strategy based on data popularity. These
   strategies duplicate files dynamically and store them in different
   locations to improve the response time of users requests and minimize
   the system energy consumption without loading network usage. The
   strategy was evaluated using the iFogSim simulator and the experimental
   results obtained are very promising.},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {30},
Number = {9},

Abstract = {As an emerging decentralized secure data management platform, blockchain
   has gained much popularity recently. To maintain a canonical state of
   blockchain data record, proof-of-work based consensus protocols provide
   the nodes, referred to as miners, in the network with incentives for
   confirming new block of transactions through a process of ``block
   mining{''} by solving a cryptographic puzzle. Under the circumstance of
   limited local computing resources, e.g., mobile devices, it is natural
   for rational miners, i.e., consensus nodes, to offload computational
   tasks for proof of work to the cloud/fog computing servers. Therefore,
   we focus on the trading between the cloud/fog computing service provider
   and miners, and propose an auction-based market model for efficient
   computing resource allocation. In particular, we consider a
   proof-of-work based blockchain network, which is constrained by the
   computing resource and deployed as an infrastructure for decentralized
   data management applications. Due to the competition among miners in the
   blockchain network, the allocative externalities are particularly taken
   into account when designing the auction mechanisms. Specifically, we
   consider two bidding schemes: the constant-demand scheme where each
   miner bids for a fixed quantity of resources, and the multi-demand
   scheme where the miners can submit their preferable demands and bids.
   For the constant-demand bidding scheme, we propose an auction mechanism
   that achieves optimal social welfare. In the multi-demand bidding
   scheme, the social welfare maximization problem is NP-hard. Therefore,
   we design an approximate algorithm which guarantees the truthfulness,
   individual rationality and computational efficiency. Through extensive
   simulations, we show that our proposed auction mechanisms with the two
   bidding schemes can efficiently maximize the social welfare of the
   blockchain network and provide effective strategies for the cloud/fog
   computing service provider.},

Abstract = {Health care monitoring systems have mainly depended on the internet of
   things (IoT) devices to collect, manage and analyze data from patients.
   Patients' health can be constantly monitored and controlled with the
   remote health monitoring systems. From these points, a Fuzzy-assisted
   machine learning framework (F-AMLF) with fog computing increases the
   effectiveness of the health care monitoring system. This paper presents
   an F-AMLF to recognize how device resource cost reduction is achieved
   while maintaining efficiency limitations. Patients can submit their
   demands for health care by a fuzzy assisted fog computing system. These
   systems use fuzzy logic to calculate how much computing capacity is
   needed to maintain fog and cloud projections. The F-AMLF shows the
   highest accuracy ratio of 93.6\%, monitoring ratio of 92.5\%, prediction
   ratio of 95.3\%, data management ratio of 91.4\%, and the lowest latency
   ratio of 19.7\%, energy consumption ratio of 20.1\%, and the
   cost-effective ratio of 21.5\% compared to the existing methods.},

Abstract = {Cloud computing with its key facets and its inherent advantages still
   faces several challenges in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. The
   distance among the IoT end devices and cloud computing might be a
   problem for latency-sensitive applications such as catastrophe
   management and content transference applications. Fog computing is a
   novel paradigm to address such issues that playacts a significant role
   in massive and real-time data management systems in an IoT environment.
   Particularly IoT data management by fog computing is one important phase
   for latency reduction in latency-sensitive applications and necessary to
   generate more skilled knowledge and intelligent decisions. In this
   study, we used the SLR (systematic literature review) method to survey
   fog data management to understand the various topics and main contexts
   in this domain that have been newly offered. The target of this article
   is classifying and analyzing the researches about the fog data
   management domain which has been released from 2014 to 2019. A
   context-based taxonomy is offered for fog data management including data
   processing, data storage and data security based on the context of
   papers that are elected with the SLR method in our study. Based on
   presented technical taxonomy, the grouped papers in any context are
   compared with each other pursuant to some metrics of fog data management
   reference model. Then, for any selected research, the new findings,
   advantages, and weaknesses are debated. Finally, based on studies the
   open issues in fog data management and their related challenges for
   future researches are highlighted.},

Abstract = {The massive onsite data produced by the Internet of Things (IoT) can
   bring valuable information and immense potentials, thus empowering a new
   wave of emerging applications. However, with the rapid increase of
   onsite IoT data streams, it has become extremely challenging to develop
   a scalable computing platform and provide a comprehensive workflow for
   processing IoT data streams with lower latency and more intelligence. To
   this end, we present a Kubernetes-based scalable fog computing platform
   (KFIML), integrating big data streaming processing with machine learning
   (ML)-based applications. We also provide a comprehensive IoT data
   processing workflow, including data access and transfer, big data
   processing, online ML, long-term storage, and monitoring. The platform
   is feasibly validated on a clustered testbed, which comprises a master
   node, IoT broker servers, worker nodes, and a local database server. By
   leveraging the lightweight orchestration system, namely Kubernetes, we
   can readily scale and manage containerized software frameworks on our
   testbed. The big data processing layer utilizes the advanced data flow
   frameworks such as Apache Flink, to support both streaming processing
   and statistical analysis with low latency. In addition, the specified
   long short-term memory (LSTM)-based ML pipelines are employed on the
   online ML layer, to enable the real-time predictive analysis of IoT data
   streams. The experiments on a real-world smart grid use case demonstrate
   that the container-based KFIML platform can be well-scaled with
   Kubernetes to efficiently perform big data processing increased onsite
   IoT data streams with lower latency and conduct ML-based applications.},

Abstract = {The rapid proliferation and progress of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)
   and Internet of Things (IoT) has conducted to the formation of a
   gigantic amount of data and a growing need to multiple new services and
   resources. In spite of the main role of Cloud computing in solving these
   issues, IoT applications need more reduced latency with mobility support
   and location awareness. To overcome the mentioned limits, a new concept
   favouring the integration of Fog computing onto IoT is increasingly
   utilized. It is a motivating scheme that offers a timely task execution
   and data management at the network edge, in a distributed way, with the
   collaboration of nearby nodes. In this paper, we provide a complete
   study of the integration of Fog onto IoT. We discuss the various
   challenges that are facing the Fog/IoT paradigm and specify the main
   contributions that have been proposed to overcome these challenges. We
   give also an insight on the relationship between IoT/Fog integration
   concept, and other leading technologies. The open issues that need more
   investigation are highlighted in this paper to identify clearly the
   research gaps in the area of Fog computing integration onto IoT.},

Title = {Improving Health Monitoring With Adaptive Data Movement in Fog Computing},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Pervasive sensing is increasing our ability to monitor the status of
   patients not only when they are hospitalized but also during home
   recovery. As a result, lots of data are collected and are available for
   multiple purposes. If operations can take advantage of timely and
   detailed data, the huge amount of data collected can also be useful for
   analytics. However, these data may be unusable for two reasons: data
   quality and performance problems. First, if the quality of the collected
   values is low, the processing activities could produce insignificant
   results. Second, if the system does not guarantee adequate performance,
   the results may not be delivered at the right time. The goal of this
   document is to propose a data utility model that considers the impact of
   the quality of the data sources (e.g., collected data, biographical
   data, and clinical history) on the expected results and allows for
   improvement of the performance through utility-driven data management in
   a Fog environment. Regarding data quality, our approach aims to consider
   it as a context-dependent problem: a given dataset can be considered
   useful for one application and inadequate for another application. For
   this reason, we suggest a context-dependent quality assessment
   considering dimensions such as accuracy, completeness, consistency, and
   timeliness, and we argue that different applications have different
   quality requirements to consider. The management of data in Fog
   computing also requires particular attention to quality of service
   requirements. For this reason, we include QoS aspects in the data
   utility model, such as availability, response time, and latency. Based
   on the proposed data utility model, we present an approach based on a
   goal model capable of identifying when one or more dimensions of quality
   of service or data quality are violated and of suggesting which is the
   best action to be taken to address this violation. The proposed approach
   is evaluated with a real and appropriately anonymized dataset, obtained
   as part of the experimental procedure of a research project in which a
   device with a set of sensors (inertial, temperature, humidity, and light
   sensors) is used to collect motion and environmental data associated
   with the daily physical activities of healthy young volunteers.},

Title = {Energy-efficient fog computing in Internet of Things based on Routing
   Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Network with Contiki},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},

Abstract = {The traditional centralized cloud computing (CC) model faces a range of
   problems with the exponential growth of the Internet of Things (IoT)
   applications, like high latency, reduced bandwidth, and network
   instability. Fog computing (FC) takes the cloud closer to IoT computers
   to overcome these problems. Rather than moving them to the cloud, the FC
   provides local IoT data processing and storage on IoT computers. This
   paper focuses on the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Network
   (RPL), a universally routing protocol for a static environment that is
   used for reducing energy consumption, delay, and packet loss with data
   aggregation at the border router using a fog simulation model in Contiki
   Cooja. The objective function (OF) choice has an impact on network
   topology, as each node selects a set of potential parents to send to the
   destination. However, no systematic analysis of the effects of OF
   behavior in the RPL environment has been undertaken. Here, three
   different OFs, Objective Function Zero (OF0), Advanced Objective
   Function Zero (AOF0), and Minimum Rank with Hysteresis Objective
   Function (MRHOF) for RPL in the static environment for different node
   numbers, have been compared. The findings demonstrate that altering all
   three OFs has a significant impact on RPL. The energy consumption is
   reduced in the case of the AOF0 in the fog node by 50.86\%, which is
   less than the case of the OF0 and MRHOF function. Extensive simulations
   show that AOF0 outperforms the existing OFs.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the rapid growth of IoT devices has led to an increase
   significantly the amount of data generated. Transferring a huge amount
   of datasets from IoT devices to remote cloud servers will result in high
   latency and bandwidth usage. Fog computing has emerged as an
   Internet-based distributed computing model to store datasets generated
   by IoT devices near the user. Since IoT devices generate continuously
   massive amounts of datasets, placing them on the storage fog nodes with
   various capabilities to reduce latency and costs of data access and
   increase reliability and availability of data datasets while satisfying
   the QoS requirements as one of the challenging tasks to be considered.
   This paper proposes a metaheuristic-based data replica placement
   mechanism using biogeography-based optimization (BBO) for data-intensive
   IoT applications on the fog ecosystem. Besides, we design an autonomous
   framework to illustrate transferring data replicas between IoT devices
   and storage fog nodes for data replica placement problem in the fog
   ecosystem. The obtained simulation results by varying the number of data
   replicas and fog nodes demonstrate that the proposed mechanism is a
   cost-effective solution and it increases the average reliability and
   availability by up 13\% and 15\% and reduces the total cost and the
   latency 25\% and 3\%, respectively, compared with the other baseline
   mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Interconnection and intercommunication between people, processes, and
   things have been enhanced with the development of the Internet of Things
   (IoT) and extended with fog computing for better efficiency. Fog
   computing improves the network services and circumvents the problem of
   escalated data management as an interface between cloud and terminal
   with the requirement of secure data transmission. In this article, a
   novel security framework is designed for fog computing intended for
   improving the security of IoT. This framework uses single point of
   aggregation from fog interface and lattice cryptographic approach to
   establish the security for the services. Azure cloud platform and Sage
   lattice cryptographic base have been employed to evaluate the
   performance of the framework. It is noticed that the Level 1-Level 2
   (L1-L2) cache implementation in the system significantly improves the
   efficiency of the framework. The results show that the proposed
   framework is robust in preventing attacks on fog nodes and additionally
   provides an advantage for low communication overhead.},

   Networks},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The fog computing-based device-driven network is a promising solution
   for high data rates in modern cellular networks. It is a unique
   framework to reduce the generated-data, data management overheads,
   network scalability challenges, and help us to provide a pervasive
   computation environment for real-time network applications, where the
   mobile data is easily available and accessible to nearby fog servers. It
   explores a new dimension of the next generation network called fog
   networks. Fog networks is a complementary part of the cloud network
   environment. The proposed network architecture is a part of the newly
   emerged paradigm that extends the network computing infrastructure
   within the device-driven 5G communication system. This work explores a
   new design of the fog computing framework to support device-driven
   communication to achieve better Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of
   Experience (QoE). In particular, we focus on, how potential is the fog
   computing orchestration framework? How it can be customized to the next
   generation of cellular communication systems? Next, we propose a
   mobility management procedure for fog networks, considering the static
   and dynamic mobile nodes. We compare our results with the legacy of
   cellular networks and observed that the proposed work has the least
   energy consumption, delay, latency, signaling cost as compared to

Title = {Fuzzy allocation model for health care data management on IoT assisted
   wearable sensor platform},
Journal = {MEASUREMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {166},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {In recent times, networking, information, and communication technologies
   are widely employed and getting spread in the area of medical
   applications. In a short period, real-time applications for healthcare
   monitoring produce a huge amount of data. Data is to be bursting in the
   case of critical applications; hence there is a greater need to enable
   reliable communication methods that ensure energy efficiency. A large
   amount of data results in high data transmission, network congestion,
   and latency, which in turn cause a hop increment between the IoT and
   cloud servers, and thus data might be unprocessed and insufficient for
   end-users. Since Fog computing is a distributed intermediate layer
   between the edge network and the cloud environment, latency can be
   reduced to a remarkable level, and the reliable communication can be
   achieved with the help of fog computing on IoT assisted wearable sensor
   platform. This research proposes a dynamic model for analysis and the
   Heuristic Hybrid Time Slot Fuzzy-Allocation Algorithm (HHTSF-AA), which
   improves health monitoring by indulging IoT assisted wearable sensor
   platform. Fog computing assisted wearable sensor platform is the most
   suitable and reliable platform for robust life-critical applications
   that are likely not to be delayed in communication. Besides, routing
   data packets are equipped with a low-cost energy minimum selection
   algorithm incorporated to improve the overall network performance.
   Dynamic slot assignment reduces time in a network and allows high levels
   of network capacity channel utilization. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Distributed fog computing has received wide attention recently. It
   enables distributed computing and data management on the network nodes
   within the close vicinity of IoT devices. An important service of
   fog-cloud based systems is data deduplication. With the increasing
   concern of privacy, some privacy-preserving data deduplication schemes
   have been proposed. However, they cannot support lossless deduplication
   of encrypted similar data in the fog-cloud network. Meanwhile, no
   existing design can protect message equality information while resisting
   brute-force and frequency analysis attacks. In this paper, we propose a
   privacy-preserving and compression-based data deduplication system under
   the fog-cloud network, which supports lossless deduplication of similar
   data in the encrypted domain. Specifically, we first use the generalized
   deduplication technique and cryptographic primitives to implement secure
   deduplication over similar data. Then, we devise a two-level
   deduplication protocol that can perform secure and efficient
   deduplication at distributed fog nodes and the cloud. The proposed
   system can not only resist brute-force and frequency analysis attacks
   but also ensure that only the data operator can capture the message
   equality information. We formally analyze the security of our design.
   Performance evaluations demonstrate that our proposed design is
   efficient in computing, storage, and communication.},

   what are the key steps to maximizing the value of data generated from
   IoT devices and also discussed the fundamental steps required to turn
   any organization's IoT data into valuable information for the business.
   Key questions should be answered by any organization that is embracing
   and offering IoT solutions and products, prior to embarking into IoT
   data analytics projects, to ensure success and avoid common pain-points.
   This paper will provide a structured approach using fusion and

Month = {SEP 25},
Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to connect devices with unique
   identifiers over a network to create an equilibrium system with high
   speeds and volumes of data while presenting an interoperability
   challenge. The IoT data management system is indispensable for attaining
   effective and efficient performance because IoT sensors generate and
   collect large amounts of data used to express large data sets. IoT data
   management has been analyzed from various perspectives in numerous
   studies. In this study, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method was
   used to investigate the various topics and key areas that have recently
   emerged in IoT data management. This study aims to classify and evaluate
   studies published between 2015 and 2021 in IoT data management.
   Therefore, the classification of studies includes five categories, data
   processing, data smartness application, data collection, data security,
   and data storage. Then, studies in each field are compared based on the
   proposed classification. Each study investigates novel findings,
   simulation/implementation, data set, application domain, experimental
   results, advantages, and disadvantages. In addition, the criteria for
   evaluating selected articles for each domain of IoT data management are
   examined. Big data accounts for the highest percentage of data
   processing fields in IoT data management, at 34\%. In addition, fast
   data processing, distributed data, artificial intelligence data with
   22\%, and data uncertainty analysis account for 11\% of the data
   processing field. Finally, studies highlight the challenges of IoT data
   management and its future directions.},

Abstract = {In Internet of Things (IoT) data processing, cloud computing alone does
   not suffice due to latency constraints, bandwidth limitations, and
   privacy concerns. By introducing intermediary nodes closer to the edge
   of the network that offer compute services in proximity to IoT devices,
   fog computing can reduce network strain and high access latency to
   application services. While this is the only viable approach to enable
   efficient IoT applications, the issue of component placement among cloud
   and intermediary nodes in the fog adds a new dimension to system design.
   State-of-the-art solutions to this issue rely on simulation or solving a
   formalized assignment problem through heuristics only, which both have
   their drawbacks. In this article, we present a five-step process for
   designing practical fog-based IoT applications that combines best
   practices, simulation, and testbed analysis to converge towards an
   efficient system architecture. We then apply this process in a smart
   factory case study. By deploying filtered options to a physical testbed,
   we show that each step of our process converges towards more efficient
   application designs.},

Title = {FoT-Stream: A Fog platform for data stream analytics in IoT},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has developed infrastructures and
   applications that generate large amounts of data. These data are usually
   yielded as streams, characterized for being continuous and infinite, and
   presenting the peculiarity of modifying their behavior over time. Due to
   the large capacity of storage, data processing, and provisioning of
   resources, such data are generally processed/analyzed in Cloud Computing
   environments. Although those environments provide IoT infrastructure
   with adequate scalability and resource-centric features, the distance
   between devices and the cloud can impose limitations to achieve low
   latency in data traffic. In order to maintain scalability, achieve low
   latency, and reduce data traffic between the IoT devices and the Cloud,
   the Fog Computing was proposed, providing resource availability at the
   edge of the network. Although Fog Computing establishes resource
   availability at the edge of the network, the technologies/techniques
   currently used for IoT data processing and analysis may not be
   sufficient to support the continuous and unlimited streams that IoT
   platforms and applications produce. In addition, data stream
   applications at Fog must be supported by the computationally limited
   devices. Therefore, aiming at taking advantage of Fog Computing and
   resolve the gap of the data stream in IoT environments, this work
   presents a new platform called FoT-Stream designed to process and
   analyze, in real-time, data stream from the Internet of Things in Fog.
   The main advantage of using our approach is the possibility of reducing
   the amount of data transmitted on the network infrastructure, which
   allows, as a consequence, to perform an online data modeling, by
   detecting changes in data behavior, and a reduction of the Internet
   usage. Our results in a real-world scenario emphasize FoT-Stream
   considerably reduces the latency and amount of data traffic in IoT
   environments without affecting the system throughput.},

Abstract = {With advances in technology, devices, machines, and appliances get
   smarter, more capable and connected to each other. This defines a new
   era called Internet of Things (IoT), consisting of a huge number of
   connected devices producing and consuming large amounts of data that may
   be needed by multiple IoT applications. At the same time, cloud
   computing and its extension to the network edge, fog computing, become
   an important way of storing and processing large amounts of data. Then,
   an important issue is how to transport, place, store, and process this
   huge amount of IoT data in an efficient and effective manner.
   In this paper, we propose a geographically distributed hierarchical
   cloud and fog computing based IoT architecture, and propose techniques
   for placing IoT data into the components, i.e., cloud and fog data
   centers, of the proposed architecture. Data is considered in different
   types and each type of data may be needed by multiple applications.
   Considering this fact, we model the data placement problem as an
   optimization problem and propose algorithms for efficient and effective
   placement of data generated and consumed by geographically distributed
   IoT nodes. Data used by multiple applications is stored only once in a
   location that is efficiently accessed by applications needing that type
   of data. We perform extensive simulation experiments to evaluate our
   proposal and the results show that our architecture and placement
   techniques can place and store data efficiently while providing good
   performance for applications and network in terms of access latency and
   bandwidth consumed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Fog computing is an emergent computing paradigm that extends the cloud
   paradigm. With the explosive growth of smart devices and mobile users,
   cloud computing no longer matches the requirements of the Internet of
   Things (IoT) era. Fog computing is a promising solution to satisfying
   these new requirements, such as low latency, uninterrupted service, and
   location awareness. As a typical new computing paradigm and network
   architecture, fog computing raises new challenges, such as privacy, data
   management, data analytics, information overload, and participatory
   sensing. In this article, we present a fog-based hybrid recommender
   system to address the issue of information overload in fog computing.
   Our proposed system not only abstracts useful information from the fog
   environment but can also be considered as an optimization tool due to
   its ability to provide suggestions to improve system performance. In
   particular, we demonstrate that the proposed system provides
   personalized and localized recommendations to users, and also advise the
   system itself to precache the content to optimize the storage capacity
   of the fog server.},

Title = {An Innovative Cloud-Fog-Based Smart Grid Scheme for Efficient Resource
   Utilization},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Smart grids (SGs) enhance the effectiveness, reliability, resilience,
   and energy-efficient operation of electrical networks. Nonetheless, SGs
   suffer from big data transactions which limit their capabilities and can
   cause delays in the optimal operation and management tasks. Therefore,
   it is clear that a fast and reliable architecture is needed to make big
   data management in SGs more efficient. This paper assesses the optimal
   operation of the SGs using cloud computing (CC), fog computing, and
   resource allocation to enhance the management problem. Technically, big
   data management makes SG more efficient if cloud and fog computing (CFC)
   are integrated. The integration of fog computing (FC) with CC minimizes
   cloud burden and maximizes resource allocation. There are three key
   features for the proposed fog layer: awareness of position, short
   latency, and mobility. Moreover, a CFC-driven framework is proposed to
   manage data among different agents. In order to make the system more
   efficient, FC allocates virtual machines (VMs) according to
   load-balancing techniques. In addition, the present study proposes a
   hybrid gray wolf differential evolution optimization algorithm (HGWDE)
   that brings gray wolf optimization (GWO) and improved differential
   evolution (IDE) together. Simulation results conducted in MATLAB verify
   the efficiency of the suggested algorithm according to the high data
   transaction and computational time. According to the results, the
   response time of HGWDE is 54 ms, 82.1 ms, and 81.6 ms faster than
   particle swarm optimization (PSO), differential evolution (DE), and GWO.
   HGWDE's processing time is 53 ms, 81.2 ms, and 80.6 ms faster than PSO,
   DE, and GWO. Although GWO is a bit more efficient than HGWDE, the
   difference is not very significant.},

Abstract = {With the improvement of IoT functions, number of devices connecting to
   Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to grow globally in future and
   those devices may have to generate a big bulk of data for processing in
   limited time. Under such environment, Data management should serve as a
   link between objects and data generating devices, as well as data
   consumer apps for analysis and action. IoT interacts with all
   communication devices and permits global access of data generated by
   devices. Cloud computing is playing a vital role in computing, network
   management and storing data but all these activities are being done in
   centralized data-centers. The centralized cloud computing can lead to
   some kind of risks like limited capacity issues, high latency and
   network failure, with the exponential growth of IoT. Cloud and fog
   computing has the answer for all such risks, as it does all computation
   or storage of IoT items locally instead of sending to cloud and thus
   this helps to provide quick results and improves Quality of service
   (QoS) for healthcare system. Cloud and fog is considered to be safest
   and quickest approach to ensure IoT delivers expected results in
   healthcare system where delay can lead to criticality for the patients.
   Fog computing becomes important as it manages data and computation at
   the network edge closest to the end user which makes it super \& quick
   reactive. Despite its compelling advantages, the characteristics of fog
   computing arise new security and privacy challenges. This paper
   investigates the various QoS parameters and discusses different security
   issues along with possible solutions in fog system. The paper also
   proposes an approach to enhance the quality of service in integrated
   cloud-fog environment.},

Abstract = {The advent of fog computing as an extension of cloud-enabling technology
   has moved from the hub of the internet framework to the unmanned aerial
   vehicle (UAV)-enabled control and man-agement of drone-based data. The
   key objectives are to improve the computation and processing of
   drone-based resource constraints and deliver the data to the outsourced
   computational node to schedule, process, manage, optimize, and preserve
   it since they are located close to each other through a wireless sensor
   network. This collaborative technological approach to robustness is the
   standard of drone system design and implementation, reducing the
   computational power, resource consumption, and latency for the
   application that needs a fast response. However, recent research into
   fog-enabled drone-based data management and optimization poses a serious
   chal-lenge in terms of privacy, security, and preservation. On the other
   hand, Blockchain Hyperledger Technology, which is mostly used in Bitcoin
   Cryptocurrencies, has been applied in a large number of distributed
   applications due to the ledger integrity, transparency, trustworthiness,
   provenance, reliability, availability, protection, and security-related
   distributed features that are provided. Therefore, the distributed
   application of drone control has received more attention because of its
   ability to handle collaborative procedures to capture, schedule,
   process, optimize, manage, and preserve drone-based data using fog nodes
   and blockchain hyperledger technology. In this paper, we proposed a
   collaborative approach using blockchain hyperledger fabric and a
   metaheuristic-enabled genetic algorithm for fog node management called
   B-Drone. This approach handles drone-based data collection, scheduling,
   optimizing, processing, managing, and preservation in a secure manner in
   the fog node. The protection of each transaction between drone and fog
   node before exchange is private with the utilization of the
   hash-encryption (SHA-256) algorithm. The blockchain smart contracts are
   implemented and deployed to auto-manage all the connectivity and
   communication protocols between drones and fog nodes in the designed
   private permissioned network. The simulations of the proposed
   collaborative approach reduce the computing cost down to 12.03\% and
   increase the performance up to 73.11\%, thus decreasing the cost of
   drone -ledger preservation down to 30.13\% and the robust usage of the
   network up to 54.29\% as compared to other state-of-the-art methods .},

Abstract = {The fog-enabled cloud computing has received considerable attention as
   the fog nodes are deployed at the network edge to provide low latency.
   It involves various activities, such as configuration management,
   security management, and data management. Monitoring these activities is
   essential to improve performance and QoS of fog computing
   infrastructure. Data collection and aggregation are the basic tasks in
   the monitoring process, and these phases consume more communicational
   power as the IoT nodes generate a huge amount of redundant data
   frequently. In this paper, a multi-agent-based data collection and
   aggregation model is proposed for monitoring fog infrastructure. The
   data collection model adopts a hybrid push-pull algorithm that updates
   the data when a certain change in new data compared to old data. A
   tree-based data aggregation model is developed to reduce communication
   overhead between fog node and cloud. The experimental results show that
   the proposed model improves data coherency and reduces communication
   overhead compared to existing data collection and aggregation models.},

Title = {Serverless data pipeline approaches for IoT data in fog and cloud
   computing},
Journal = {FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {130},
Pages = {91-105},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {With the increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, massive
   amounts of raw data is being generated. The latency, cost, and other
   challenges in cloud-based IoT data processing have driven the adoption
   of Edge and Fog computing models, where some data processing tasks are
   moved closer to data sources. Properly dealing with the flow of such
   data requires building data pipelines, to control the complete life
   cycle of data streams from data acquisition at the data source, edge and
   fog processing, to Cloud side storage and analytics. Data analytics
   tasks need to be executed dynamically at different distances from the
   data sources and often on very heterogeneous hardware devices. This can
   be streamlined by the use of a Serverless (or FaaS) cloud computing
   model, where tasks are defined as virtual functions, which can be
   migrated from edge to cloud (and vice versa) and executed in an
   event-driven manner on data streams. In this work, we investigate the
   benefits of building Serverless data pipelines (SDP) for IoT data
   analytics and evaluate three different approaches for designing SDPs:
   (1) Off-the-shelf data flow tool (DFT) based, (2) Object storage service
   (OSS) based and (3) MQTT based. Further, we applied these strategies on
   three fog applications (Aeneas, PocketSphinx, and custom Video
   processing application) and evaluated the performance by comparing their
   processing time (computation time, network communication and disk access
   time), and resource utilization. Results show that DFT is unsuitable for
   compute-intensive applications such as video or image processing,
   whereas OSS is best suitable for this task. However, DFT is nicely fit
   for bandwidthintensive applications due to the minimum use of network
   resources. On the other hand, MQTT-based SDP is observed with increase
   in CPU and Memory usage as the number of users rose, and experienced a
   drop in data units in the pipeline for PocketSphinx and custom video
   processing applications, however it performed well for Aeneas which had
   low size data units. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Background: With the further development of the electric Internet of
   Things (eIoT), IoT devices in the distributed network generate data with
   different frequencies and types.
   Objective: Fog platform is located between the smart collected terminal
   and cloud platform, and the resources of fog computing are limited,
   which affects the delay of service processing time and response time.
   Methods: In this paper, an algorithm of fog resource scheduling and load
   balancing is proposed. First, the fog devices divide the tasks into high
   or low priority. Then, the fog management nodes cluster the fog nodes
   through the K-mean+ algorithm and implement the earliest deadline first
   dynamic ( EDFD) task scheduling algorithm and De-REF neural network load
   balancing algorithm.
   Results: We use tools to simulate the environment, and the results show
   that this method has strong advantages in -30\% response time, -50\%
   scheduling time, delay, -50\% load balancing rate, and energy
   consumption, which provides a better guarantee for eIoT.
   Conclusion: Resource scheduling is an important factor affecting system
   performance. This article mainly addresses the needs of eIoT in terminal
   network communication delay, connection failure, and resource shortage.
   A new method of resource scheduling and load balancing is proposed. The
   evaluation was performed, and it proved that our proposed algorithm has
   better performance than the previous method, which brings new
   opportunities for the realization of eIoT.},

Abstract = {Fog computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) played a crucial role in
   storing data in the third-party server. Fog computing provides various
   resources to collect data by managing data security. However,
   intermediate attacks and data sharing create enormous security
   challenges like data privacy, confidentiality, authentication, and
   integrity issues. Various researchers introduce several cryptographic
   techniques; security is still significant while sharing data in the
   distributed environment. Therefore, in this paper, Code-Based Encryption
   with the Energy Consumption Routing Protocol (CBE-ECR) has been proposed
   for managing data security and data transmission protocols using
   keyed-hash message authentication. Initially, the data have been
   analyzed, and the distributed cluster head is selected, and the
   stochastically distributed energy clustering protocol is utilized for
   making the data transmission. Code-driven cryptography relies on the
   severity of code theory issues such as disorder demodulation and
   vibration required to learn equivalence. These crypto-systems are based
   on error codes to build a single-way function. The encryption technique
   minimizes intermediate attacks, and the data have protected all means of
   transmission. In addition to data security management, the introduced
   CBE-ECR reduces unauthorized access and manages the network lifetime
   successfully, leading to the effective data management of 96.17\% and
   less energy consumption of 21.11\% than other popular methods.The
   effectiveness of the system is compared to the traditional clustering
   techniques.},

Title = {An Efficient Data-Balancing Cyber-Physical System Paradigm for
   Quality-of-Service (QoS) Provision over Fog Computing},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) have greatly contributed to many
   applications. A CPS is capable of integrating physical and computational
   capabilities to interact with individuals through various new
   modalities. However, there is a need for such a paradigm to focus on the
   human central nervous system to provide faster data access. This paper
   introduces the CPS paradigm that consists of CPS enabled human brain
   monitoring (CPS-HBM) and efficient data-balancing for CPS (EDB-CPS). The
   CPS-HBM provides architectural support to make an efficient and secure
   transfer and storage of the sensed data over fog cloud computing. The
   CPS-HBM consists of four components: physical domain and data processing
   (PDDP), brain sensor network (BSN), Service-oriented architecture (SOA),
   and data management domain (DMD). The EDB-CPS module aims to balance
   data flow for obtaining better throughput and lower hop-to-hop delay.
   The EDB-CPS accomplishes the goal by employing three processes: A node
   advertisement (NA), A node selection and recruitment (NSR), and optimal
   distance determination with mid-point (ODDMP). The processes of the
   EDB-CPS are performed on the PDDP of the CPS-HBM module. Thus, to
   determine the validity of EDB-CPS, the paradigm was programmed with C++
   and implemented on a network simulator-3 (NS3). Finally, the performance
   of the proposed EDB-CPS was compared with state-of-the-art methods in
   terms of hop-to-hop delay and throughput. The proposed EDB-CPS produced
   better throughput between 443.2-445.2 KB/s and 0.05-0.078 ms hop-to-hop
   delay.},

Journal = {PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {85},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Fog Computing (FC) based IoT applications are encountering a bottleneck
   in the data management and resource optimization due to the dynamic IoT
   topologies, resource-limited devices, resource diversity, mismatching
   service quality, and complicated service offering environments. Existing
   problems and emerging demands of FC based IoT applications are hard to
   be met by traditional IP-based Internet model. Therefore, in this paper,
   we focus on the Content-Centric Network (CCN) model to provide more
   efficient, flexible, and reliable data and resource management for
   fog-based IoT systems. We first propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning
   (DRL) algorithm that jointly considers the content type and status of
   fog servers for content-centric data and computation offloading. Then,
   we introduce a novel virtual layer called FogOrch that orchestrates the
   management and performance requirements of fog layer resources in an
   efficient manner via the proposed DRL agent. To show the feasibility of
   FogOrch, we develop a content-centric data offloading scheme (DRLOS)
   based on the DRL algorithm running on FogOrch. Through extensive
   simulations, we evaluate the performance of DRLOS in terms of total
   reward, computational workload, computation cost, and delay. The results
   show that the proposed DRLOS is superior to existing benchmark
   offloading schemes.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {mySense: A comprehensive data management environment to improve

Abstract = {Over the last few years, an extensive set of technologies have been
   systematically included in precision agriculture (PA) and also in
   precision viticulture (PV) practices, as tools that allow efficient
   monitoring of nearly any parameter to achieve sustainable crop
   management practices and to increase both crop yield and quality.
   However, many technologies and standards are not yet included on those
   practices. Therefore, potential benefits that may result from putting
   together agronomic knowledge with electronics and computer technologies
   are still not fully accomplished.
   Both emergent and established paradigms, such as the Internet of
   Everything (IoE), Internet of Things (IoT), cloud and fog computing,
   together with increasingly cheaper computing technologies - with very
   low power requirements and a diversity of wireless technologies,
   available to exchange data with increased efficiency - and intelligent
   systems, have evolved to a level where it is virtually possible to
   expeditiously create and deploy any required monitoring solution.
   Pushed by all of these technological trends and recent developments,
   data integration has emerged as the layer between crops and knowledge
   needed to efficiently manage it. In this paper, the mySense environment
   is presented, aimed to systematize data acquisition procedures to
   address common PA/PV issues. mySense builds over a 4-layer technological
   structure: sensor and sensor nodes, crop field and sensor networks,
   cloud services and support to front-end applications. It makes available

Abstract = {Traffic monitoring system empowers cloud server and drivers to collect
   real-time driving information and acquire traffic conditions. However,
   drivers are more interested in local traffic, and sending driving
   reports to a faraway cloud server wastes a lot of bandwidth and incurs a
   long response delay. Recently, fog computing is introduced to provide
   location-sensitive and latency-aware local data management in vehicular
   crowdsensing, but it incurs new privacy concerns since drivers'
   information could be disclosed. Although these messages are encrypted
   before transmission, malicious drivers can upload false reports to
   sabotage the systems, and filtering out false encrypted reports remains
   a challenging issue. To address the problems, we define a new security
   model and propose a privacy preserving traffic monitoring scheme.
   Specifically, we utilize short group signature to authenticate drivers
   in a conditionally anonymous way, adopt a range query technique to
   acquire driving information in a privacy-preserving way, and integrate
   it to the construction of a weighted proximity graph at each fog node
   through a WiFi challenge handshake to filter out false reports.
   Moreover, we use variant Bloom filters to achieve fast traffic
   conditions storage and retrieval. Finally, we prove security and
   privacy, evaluate performance with real-world cloud servers.},

Title = {PF-BTS: A Privacy-Aware Fog-enhanced Blockchain-assisted task scheduling},
Journal = {INFORMATION PROCESSING \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In recent years, the deployment of Cloud Computing (CC) has become more
   popular both in research and industry applications, arising form various
   fields including e-health, manufacturing, logistics and social
   networking. This is due to the easiness of service deployment and data
   management, and the unlimited provision of virtual resources (VR). In
   simple scenarios, users/applications send computational or storage tasks
   to be executed in the cloud, by manually assigning those tasks to the
   available computational resources. In complex scenarios, such as a smart
   city applications, where there is a large number of tasks, VRs, or both,
   task scheduling is exposed as an NP-Hard problem. Consequently, it is
   preferred and more efficient in terms of time and effort, to use a task
   scheduling automation technique. As there are many automated scheduling
   solutions proposed, new possibilities arise with the advent of Fog
   Computing (FC) and Blockchain (BC) technologies. Accordingly, such
   automation techniques may help the quick, secure and efficient
   assignment of tasks to the available VRs. In this paper, we propose an
   Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm in a Fog-enabled
   Blockchain-assisted scheduling model, namely PF-BTS. The protocol and
   algorithms of PF-BTS exploit BC miners for generating efficient
   assignment of tasks to be performed in the cloud's VRs using ACO, and
   award miner nodes for their contribution in generating the best
   schedule. In our proposal, PF-BTS further allows the fog to process,
   manage, and perform the tasks to enhance latency measures. While this
   processing and managing is taking place, the fog is enforced to respect
   the privacy of system components, and assure that data, location,
   identity, and usage information are not exposed. We evaluate and compare
   PF-BTS performance, with a recently proposed Blockchain-based task
   scheduling protocol, in a simulated environment. Our evaluation and
   experiments show high privacy awareness of PF-BTS, along with noticeable
   enhancement in execution time and network load.},

Abstract = {Cloud server and fog computing have been utilized to manage enormous
   volumes of data with low service transmission time in Internet of Things
   (IoT) environment. However, untrustworthy relationships between network
   entities and cloud server cause a lot of security concerns. Many
   researches have been studied based on traditional cryptosystems for data
   sharing systems. But they lead to key management difficulty and do not
   ensure the data owner's authority by depending on Trusted Third Party
   (TTP). Therefore, we use key aggregate searchable encryption (KASE),
   which enables owners to exercise their rights in data management and
   sharing without the help of TTP and resolves the key management problem.
   In this paper, we propose a secure data sharing system based on KASE in
   fog-enabled IoT environment using blockchain. We prove the resistance of
   the proposed scheme against various attacks through informal analysis
   and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications
   (AVISPA) simulation tool. We prove the guarantee of secure mutual
   authentcation using Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic. Furthermore, we
   compare security features and performance of the proposed scheme with
   existing schemes through Multiprecision Integer and Rational Arithmetic
   Cryptographic Library (MIRACL).},

Abstract = {In industrial wireless sensors networks (IWSNs) deployments, data
   management and processing tasks are often delegated to centralized
   computing facilities. Albeit providing an abundance of resources, these
   solutions impose several drawbacks, stemming from the higher latency
   they may introduce, as well as from security/privacy issues. To deal
   with these shortcomings, in this article, we propose an architecture
   designed for industrial monitoring duties, based on the Fog computing
   paradigm. In particular, we devised a Fog layer to host a data
   aggregation algorithm based on singular value decomposition (SVD).
   Considering a real-world case study about a distributed monitoring
   system for industrial motors, the benefits of the proposed solution in
   terms of network performances, i.e., latency and packet delivery ratio,
   are analyzed using the OMNET++ simulator. Besides, the system implements
   a set of security mechanisms at different levels (i.e., IWSN, Fog, and
   Cloud). In particular, we propose a new lightweight and energy-efficient
   ciphering algorithm for resource-constrained industrial motes. According
   to our experiments, the new algorithm reduces energy consumption by a
   factor of three compared to Advanced Encryption Standard-128.},

Abstract = {The Agriculture 4.0, also called Smart Agriculture or Smart Farming, is
   at the origin of the production of huge amount of data that must be
   collected, stored, and processed in a very short time. Processing this
   massive quantity of data needs to use specific infrastructure that use
   adapted IoT architectures. Our review offers a comparative panorama of
   Central Cloud, Distributed Cloud Architectures, Collaborative Computing
   Strategies, and new trends used in the context of Agriculture 4.0. In
   this review, we try to answer 4 research questions: (1) Which storage
   and processing architectures are best suited to Agriculture 4.0
   applications and respond to its peculiarities? (2) Can generic
   architectures meet the needs of Agriculture 4.0 application cases? (3)
   What are the horizontal development possibilities that allow the
   transition from research to industrialization? (4) What are the vertical
   valuations possibilities to move from algorithms trained in the cloud to
   embedded or stand-alone products? For this, we compare archi-tectures
   with 8 criteria (User Proximity, Latency \& Jitter, Network stability,
   high throughput, Reliability, Scalability, Cost Effectiveness,
   Maintainability), and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each
   of them.(c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of

Abstract = {In this paper, a new layered architecture is proposed for big
   data-driven processing and management of future smart homes. The
   proposed Representational State Transfer (REST)-based architecture
   includes seven layers: physical, fog-computing, network,
   cloud-computing, service, session, and application for efficient data
   exchange and processing tasks of future smart homes. The smart home
   physical layer includes all the sensing technologies and smart devices
   within the smart home, which monitors the home environment and its
   residents. The data of these sensors will be sent to the smart home
   fog-computing layer that can do limited data storage and processing.
   Then, all the required data will be sent to the cloud-computing layer
   using smart home network layer. The cloud-computing layer provides the
   scalable solution for data processing and storage. The processed data in
   the cloud-computing layer will be provided as the data-driven services
   to different smart home and third-party (e.g., smart city) applications
   via smart home service layer. Based on the proposed architecture, the
   applications will utilize the session layer and RESTFUL APIs to use the
   data-driven services of the smart home. The proposed smart home
   architecture can provide a ubiquitous and shared data environment as the
   key aspect of Internet-of-Things systems.},

Abstract = {Biological threats are becoming a serious security issue for many
   countries across the world. Effective biosurveillance systems can
   primarily support appropriate responses to biological threats and
   consequently save human lives. Nevertheless, biosurveillance systems are
   costly to implement and hard to operate. Furthermore, they rely on
   static infrastructures that might not cope with the evolving dynamics of
   the monitored environment. In this paper, we present a reorganizing
   biosurveillance framework for the detection and localization of
   biological threats with fog and mobile edge computing support. In the
   proposed framework, a hierarchy of fog nodes are responsible for
   aggregating monitoring data within their regions and detecting potential
   threats. Although fog nodes are deployed on a fixed base station
   infrastructure, the framework provides an innovative technique for
   reorganizing the monitored environment structure to adapt to the
   evolving environmental conditions and to overcome the limitations of the
   static base station infrastructure. Evaluation results illustrate the
   ability of the framework to localize biological threats and detect
   infected areas. Moreover, the results show the effectiveness of the
   reorganization mechanisms in adjusting the environment structure to cope
   with the highly dynamic environment.},

Title = {A comprehensive study on managing strategies in the fog environments},
Journal = {TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Although cloud computing application is rising, some unanswered problems
   still exist because of its inner issues like untrustworthy inactivity,
   the absence of movement backing, and place awareness. Therefore, fog
   computing has appeared as a hopeful infrastructure to supply flexible
   resources at the edge of the network. Fog supplies processing, data,
   storing, and application amenities to ultimate operators. The management
   strategies have a great impact on fog computing, such as monitoring and
   optimizing, the correlated components for improving the performance,
   availability, security, and any fundamental operational requirement.
   However, as far as we know, no organized study exists about analyzing
   their importance in fog environments. This paper provides a detailed
   survey for covering the current state-of-the-art in fog management. This
   paper classifies the management strategies into three main categories:
   data management, energy, and resource. We also presented a few prospects
   and problems like the suggestions for the upcoming studies in the
   associated methods requiring to be investigated in fog computing.
   Moreover, a new paradigm has been ensured by increasing fog
   functionality and resource consumption. In general, fog management
   strategies in computing environments still need improvements in the
   variety of its setting to convert to an on-request method, decrease the
   associated overhead, and improve the performance. Therefore, proper
   management can maintain the least resource consumption, which will
   finish the extra decrease in energy usage. Therefore, we contribute to
   provide strong suggestions for future fog computing studies. This paper
   can handle the pace of publications and propose the outcomes of study
   and practice as an upcoming route for decision makers in healthcare. In
   principle, the increase of researchers, scientists and managers'
   awareness level would increase the managers' good and knowingly
   behavioral conduct on managing fog environments.},

Title = {A scalable IoT-fog framework for urban sound sensing},
Journal = {COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {153},
Pages = {302-310},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated devices that can be
   used to allow large-scale collection and analysis of data. However, as
   it grew, IoT networks were not capable of managing the data from these
   services. As a result, cloud computing was introduced to address the
   need for datacentres for IoT networks. As the technology evolved, the
   demand for a proper means of supporting and managing crowdsensing and
   real-time data increased, and cloud servers could no longer keep up with
   the large volumes of incoming data. This demand brought rise to fog
   computing. It became an extension to the cloud and allowed resources to
   be allocated around the network effectively. Its integration to IoT
   reduced the strain towards the cloud servers. However, issues in high
   power consumption at the end device and data management constraints
   surfaced. This paper proposes two approaches to alleviate these issues
   to keep fog computing remain as a reliable option for IoT-related
   applications. We created an IoT-based sensing framework that used an
   urban sound classification model. Through active low and high power
   states and resource reallocation, we created a network configuration. We
   tested this configuration against IoT frameworks that use the default
   fog and cloud setups. The results improved the framework's end device
   power consumption and server latency. Overall, with the proposed
   framework, fog computing was proven to be capable of supporting a
   scalable IoT framework for urban sound sensing.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {6262-6268},
Abstract = {With the recent increase in the number of IoT devices and the
   development of centralized management systems, risks in cyber space,
   including personal information phishing, malicious code infection,
   hacking, and DDos attack, are becoming major issues in the real world.
   The recently developed distributed data management technology,
   blockchain, provides reliability in transactions without the
   intervention of a third party. This new technology, blockchain, promotes
   integrity and reliability of transaction records by allowing for all
   network participants to jointly own and verify data, which was
   previously done by a central server. Due to distributed data management,
   the technology can reduce brokerage fees and construction costs, and
   guarantees high levels of integrity and security of data. This paper
   examines the effective identifier management using blockchain technology
   under the named data networking environment. The proposed system does
   not expose a specific user's identifier by creating a transaction using
   the content name of the identifier. The identifier can be safely stored
   and managed through such an identifier split management technique.},

Abstract = {The Cloud computing paradigm has revolutionised the computer science
   horizon during the past decade and has enabled the emergence of
   computing as the fifth utility. It has captured significant attention of
   academia, industries, and government bodies. Now, it has emerged as the
   backbone of modern economy by offering subscription-based services
   anytime, anywhere following a pay-as-you-go model. This has instigated
   (1) shorter establishment times for start-ups, (2) creation of scalable
   global enterprise applications, (3) better cost-to-value associativity
   for scientific and high-performance computing applications, and (4)
   different invocation/execution models for pervasive and ubiquitous
   applications. The recent technological developments and paradigms such
   as serverless computing, software-defined networking, Internet of
   Things, and processing at network edge are creating new opportunities
   for Cloud computing. However, they are also posing several new
   challenges and creating the need for new approaches and research
   strategies, as well as the re-evaluation of the models that were
   developed to address issues such as scalability, elasticity,
   reliability, security, sustainability, and application models. The
   proposed manifesto addresses them by identifying the major open
   challenges in Cloud computing, emerging trends, and impact areas. It
   then offers research directions for the next decade, thus helping in the
   realisation of Future Generation Cloud Computing.},

Abstract = {Recently, drones (or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)) are getting
   increasing attention and taking mobile computing to a new era. Due to
   the support of highly advanced technologies, soon they might be
   ubiquitous and networks of drones might be used in providing civilian
   drone services. In this paper, we provide a survey of drone services and
   applications, data management for drones, data services using drones,
   distributed computing trends fuelled by drones and a range of
   human-drone interaction research which is useful if drones are to
   regularly serve nontechnical users, while highlighting the specific
   concerns in data management and airborne Internet-of-Things (IoT)
   computing infrastructure. We present concepts such as
   drones-as-a-service and fly-in, fly-out computing infrastructure, and
   note data management and system design issues that arise in these
   situations. Issues of Big Data arising from such applications,
   optimising the configuration of airborne and ground infrastructure to
   provide the best QoS and QoE, situation-awareness, scalability,
   reliability, scheduling for efficiency, interaction with users and
   drones using different methods are noted.},

Title = {Secure Fog-Assisted Crowdsensing With Collusion Resistance: From Data
   Reporting to Data Requesting},

Volume = {6},

Abstract = {The development and ubiquity of smart mobile devices have produced the
   idea of crowdsensing, where people report and request data in a
   community via a cloud server. Recently, fog is introduced to assist the
   cloud server by providing location-sensitive and latency-aware local
   data management. However, interaction between users and server without
   appropriate sanitation puts serious security threats to user' privacy
   (e.g., data content and preference). While existing work already has a
   wide range of privacy-preserving schemes, they hardly consider collusion
   attacks (CAs) between the server and users, let alone CAs between fog
   nodes and users. To solve this problem, we first define four specific
   CAs in fog-assisted crowdsensing and propose a novel privacy-preserving
   data reporting and requesting (PARE) scheme with collusion resistance.
   PARE is constructed by leveraging one-way hash chains, marked mix-nets,
   and grouping-based secure searchable encryption to securely collect
   users' reports and respond to users' requests under CAs. Then, we
   consider one extreme scenario and provide a solution by introducing a
   role of sentry reporter while reducing computational costs and
   communication overhead. Thorough security and privacy analysis shows
   that PARE is secure and collusion resistant and we also quantitatively
   measure privacy with mutual information. Extensive performance
   evaluation results indicate that PARE is lightweight with respect to
   computational cost and communication overhead. To the best of our
   knowledge, this paper is the first one that gives four formal
   definitions of CAs in fog-assisted crowdsensing and aim to defend them
   at the same time.},

Abstract = {The papers in this special focus on enabling technologies for next
   generation telehealthcare applications. The use of Information and
   Communication Technology (ICT) for health and well-being is rapidly
   increasing in the majority of high-income countries. The interest about
   telehealthcare allows the provisioning of various kinds of
   health-related services and applications over the Internet. There are
   several benefits associated with tele-healthcare, including: the
   reduction of infection risk due to optimized patients access to clinical
   centers; optimized healthcare workflows; containment of hospital costs;
   increased patient safety; improves in the quality of life of both
   patients and their families. Common telehealthcare applications include
   tele-nursing, tele-rehabilitation, tele-dialog, tele-monitoring,
   tele-analysis, tele-pharmacy, tele-care, tele-psychiatry,
   tele-radiology, tele-pathology, teledermatology, tele-dentistry,
   tele-audiology, tele-ophthalmology, etc. In the past ten years, key
   enabling technologies (KETs) such as Internet of Things (IoT), tools for

Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {With innovation in persistent technologies, such as wearable sensor
   gadgets, sensor devices, and wireless ad-hoc communication networks
   connect everyday life things to the Internet, normally referred to as
   Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is observed as an active entity for design
   and development of smart and context awareness services and applications
   in the area of business, science and engineering discipline. These
   applications and services could vigorously respond to the surroundings
   transformation and users' preference. Developing a scalable system for
   data analysis, processing and mining of enormous real world based
   datasets has turned into one of the demanding problems that faces both
   system research scholars and data management research scholars.
   Employing big data analytics with IoT technologies is one of the ways
   for handling the timely analyzing information (i.e., data, events)
   streams. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach that coalesce
   IoT systems with big data tools into a holistic platform for real-time
   and continuous data monitoring and processing. We propose Fog assisted
   IoT based Smart and real time healthcare information processing (SRHIP)
   system in which large amounts of data generated by IoT sensor devices
   are offloaded at Fog cloud form data analytics and processing with
   minimum delay. The processed data is then transferred to a centralized
   cloud system for further analysis and storage. In this work, we
   introduce a Fog-assisted model with big data environment for data
   analytic of real time data with remote monitoring and discuss our plan
   for evaluating its efficacy in terms of several performance metrics such
   as transmission cost, storage cost, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity
   and F-measure. The proposed SRHIP system needs less transmission cost of
   40.10\% in comparison to SPPDA, 100\% fewer bytes are compromised in
   comparison to GCEDA. Our proposed system data size reduction of 60\%
   reduction due to proposed compression scheme in comparison to other
   benchmark strategies that offer 40\% of reduction.},

Abstract = {The recent COVID-19 outbreak highlighted the requirement for a more
   sophisticated healthcare system and real-time data analytics in the
   pandemic mitigation process. Moreover, real-time data plays a crucial
   role in the detection and alerting process. Combining smart healthcare
   systems with accurate real-time information about medical service
   availability, vaccination, and how the pandemic is spreading can
   directly affect the quality of life and economy. The existing
   architecture models are become inadequate in handling the pandemic
   mitigation process using real-time data. The present models are
   server-centric and controlled by a single party, where the management of
   confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of data is doubtful.
   Therefore, a decentralised user-centric model is necessary, where the
   CIA of user data is assured. In this paper, we have suggested a
   decentralized blockchain-based pandemic detection and assistance system
   (iBlock). The iBlock uses robust technologies like hybrid computing and
   IPFS to support system functionality. A pseudo-anonymous personal
   identity is introduced using H-PCS and cryptography for anonymous data
   sharing. The distributed data management module guarantees data CIA,
   security, and privacy using cryptography mechanisms. Furthermore, it
   delivers useful intelligent information in the form of suggestions and
   alerts to assist the users. Finally, the iBlock reduces stress on
   healthcare infrastructure and workers by providing accurate predictions
   and early warnings using AI/ML.},

Abstract = {Fog computing has emerged as a promising paradigm that borrows the
   user-oriented cloud services to the proximity of the Internet-of-Things
   (IoT) users in sixth-generation (6G) networks. Currently, service
   providers establish a proprietary fog architecture to prolong a specific
   group of IoT users by offering resources and services to the edge level.
   However, this sort of activity creates a service barrier and limits the
   development of fog services to the IoT-users. Keeping this in mind, we
   develop a 6G-aware fog federation model for utilizing maximum fog
   resources and providing demand specific services across the network
   while maximizing the revenue of fog service providers and guaranteeing
   the minimum service delay and price for IoT-users. To achieve this goal,
   we formulate our objective function into a mixed-integer nonlinear
   problem. By jointly optimizing the dynamic services cost and user
   demands, a noncooperative Stackelberg game interaction algorithm is
   formulated to schedule the fog and cloud resources distributively.
   Further maximizing the profit for the service providers and the seamless
   resource provisioning, a resource controller is initiated to manage the
   available fog resources. Extensive simulation analysis over 6G-aware
   Quality-of-Service parameters demonstrates the superiority of the
   proposed fog federation model and it reduces up to 15\%-20\% service
   delay and 20\%-25\% of service cost over the standalone fog and cloud
   frameworks.},

Title = {A comprehensive survey on software-defined networking for smart
   communities},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUL 18},
Abstract = {The need to provide services closer to the end-user proximity leads to
   the exchange of a large volume of data generated from the smart devices
   deployed at different geo-distributed sites. The massive amount of data
   generated from the smart devices need to be transmitted, analyzed, and
   processed. This requires seamless data exchanges among geo-separated
   nodes, which results in a considerable burden on the underlying network
   infrastructure and can degrade the performance of any implemented
   solution. Therefore, a dynamic, agile, and programmable network
   management paradigm is required. To handle the challenges mentioned
   above, software-defined networking (SDN) gained much attention from
   academia, researchers, and industrial sectors. Shifting the
   computational load from forwarding devices to a logically centralized
   controller is a dream of every network operator who wants to have
   complete control and global visibility of the network. Also, the concept
   of network functions virtualization (NFV) in SDN controller is required
   to increase resource utilization efficiency. Thus, in this paper, a
   comprehensive survey on SDN for various smart applications is presented.
   This survey covers the infrastructural details of SDN hardware and
   OpenFlow switches, controllers, simulation tools, programming languages,
   open issues, and challenges in SDN implementation with advanced
   technologies such as 5G and microservices. In addition, the challenges
   on the control plane and data plane are highlighted in detail, such as
   fault tolerance, routing, scheduling of flows, and energy consumption on
   OpenFlow switches. Finally, various open issues and challenges future
   scope of SDN are discussed and analyzed in the proposal.},

Title = {IoT Registration and Authentication in Smart City Applications with
   Blockchain},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The advent of 5G will bring a massive adoption of IoT devices across our
   society. IoT Applications (IoT Apps) will be the primary data collection
   base. This scenario leads to unprecedented scalability and security
   challenges, with one of the first areas for these applications being
   Smart Cities (SC). IoT devices in new network paradigms, such as Edge
   Computing and Fog Computing, will collect data from urban environments,
   providing real-time management information. One of these challenges is
   ensuring that the data sent from Edge Computing are reliable. Blockchain
   has been a technology that has gained the spotlight in recent years, due
   to its robust security in fintech and cryptocurrencies. Its strong
   encryption and distributed and decentralized network make it potential
   for this challenge. Using Blockchain with IoT makes it possible for SC
   applications to have security information distributed, which makes it
   possible to shield against Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS). IoT
   devices in an SC can have a long life, which increases the chance of
   having security holes caused by outdated firmware. Adding a layer of
   identification and verification of attributes and signature of messages
   coming from IoT devices by Smart Contracts can bring confidence in the
   content. SC Apps that extract data from legacy and outdated appliances,
   installed in inaccessible, unknown, and often untrusted urban
   environments can benefit from this work. Our work's main contribution is
   the development of API Gateways to be used in IoT devices and network
   gateway to sign, identify, and authorize messages. For this, keys and
   essential characteristics of the devices previously registered in
   Blockchain are used. We will discuss the importance of this
   implementation while considering the SC and present a testbed that is
   composed of Blockchain Ethereum and real IoT devices. We analyze the
   transfer time, memory, and CPU impacts during the sending and processing
   of these messages. The messages are signed, identified, and validated by
   our API Gateways and only then collected for an IoT data management
   application.},

Title = {Edge Computing Technology Enablers: A Systematic Lecture Study},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {69264-69302},
Abstract = {With the increasing stringent QoS constraints (e.g., latency, bandwidth,
   jitter) imposed by novel applications (e.g., e-Health, autonomous
   vehicles, smart cities, etc.), as well as the rapidly increasing number
   of connected IoT (Internet of Things) devices, the core network is
   becoming increasingly congested. To cope with those constraints, Edge
   Computing (EC) is emerging as an innovative computing paradigm that
   leverages Cloud computing and brings it closer to the customer. ``EC{''}
   refers to transferring computing power and intelligence from the central
   Cloud to the network's Edge. With that, EC promotes the idea of
   processing and caching data at the Edge, thus reducing network
   congestion and latency. This paper presents a detailed, thorough, and
   well-structured assessment of Edge Computing and its enabling
   technologies. Initially, we start by defining EC from the ground up,
   outlining its architectures and evolution from Cloudlets to Multi-Access
   Edge Computing. Next, we survey recent studies on the main cornerstones
   of an EC system, including resource management, computation offloading,
   data management, network management, etc. Besides, we emphasized EC
   technology enablers, starting with Edge Intelligence, the branch of
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) that integrates AI models at
   resource-constrained edge nodes with significant heterogeneity and
   mobility. Then, moving on to 5G and its empowering technologies, we
   explored how EC and 5G complement each other. After that, we studied
   virtualization and containerization as promising hosting runtime for
   edge applications. Further to that, we delineated a variety of EC
   use-case scenarios, e.g., smart cities, e-Health, military applications,
   etc. Finally, we concluded our survey by highlighting the role of EC
   integration with future concerns regarding green energy and
   standardization.},

   continuously generate enormous amounts of data which demand strict

   paradigms. Subsequently, we critically review the state-of-the-art
   literature focusing on edge computing applications in smart cities.
   Later, we categorize and classify the literature by devising a
   comprehensive and meticulous taxonomy. Furthermore, we identify and
   discuss key requirements, and enumerate recently reported synergies of
   edge computing-enabled smart cities. Finally, several indispensable open
   challenges along with their causes and guidelines are discussed, serving

Volume = {8},
Pages = {188082-188134},
Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is an integration of the Sensor, Embedded,
   Computing, and Communication technologies. The purpose of the IoT is to
   provide seamless services to anything, anytime at any place. IoT
   technologies play a crucial role everywhere, which brings the fourth
   revolution of disruptive technologies after the internet and Information
   and Communication Technology (ICT). The Research \& Development
   community has predicted that the impact of IoT will be more than the
   internet and ICT on society, which improves the well-being of society
   and industries. Addressing the predominant system-level design aspects
   like energy efficiency, robustness, scalability, interoperability, and
   security issues result in the use of a potential IoT system. This paper
   presents the current state of art of the functional pillars of IoT and
   its emerging applications to motivate academicians and researches to
   develop real-time, energy-efficient, scalable, reliable, and secure IoT
   applications. This paper summarizes the architecture of IoT, with the
   contemporary status of IoT architectures. Highlights of the IoT
   system-level issues to develop more advanced real-time IoT applications
   have been discussed. Millions of devices exchange information using
   different communication standards, and interoperability between them is
   a significant issue. This paper provides the current status of the
   communication standards and application layer protocols used in IoT with
   the detailed analysis. The computing paradigms like Cloud, Cloudlet,
   Fog, and Edge computing facilitate IoT with various services like data
   offloading, resource and device management, etc. In this paper, an
   exhaustive analysis of Edge Computing in IoT with different edge
   computing architectures and existing status are deliberated. The
   widespread adoption of IoT in society has resulted in privacy and
   security issues. This paper emphasizes on analyzing the security
   challenges, privacy and security threats, conventional mitigation
   techniques, and further scope for IoT security. The features like fewer
   memory footprints, scheduling, real-time task execution, fewer
   interrupt, and thread switching latency of Real-Time Operating Systems
   (RTOS) enables the development of time critical IoT applications. Also,
   this review offers the analysis of the RTOS's suitable for IoT with the
   current status and networking stack. Finally, open research issues in
   IoT system development are discussed.},
