Thus, there is a need to investigate Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based application design concepts within social VRLEs to offer scalable, cost-efficient services that adapt to dynamic cloud/fog system conditions. In this paper, we investigate the cost-performance trade-offs for an IoT-based application that integrates large-scale sensor data from Social VRLEs and coordinates the real-time data processing and visualization across cloud/fog platforms. To facilitate dynamic performance adaptation of the IoT-based application with increased user scale, we present a set of cost-aware adaptive control rules. The implementation of the rules is based on an analytical queuing model that determines the performance states of the IoT-based application, given the current workload and the allocated cloud/fog resources. Using the IoT-based application in an exemplar VRLE use case, we evaluate the cost-performance trade-offs with three system architectures i.e., cloud-only, edge-only and edge-cloud architectures. Experiment results illustrate the best/worst practices in the cost-performance trade-offs for a range of simulated IoT scenarios involving monitoring user emotional data collected by using brain sensors. Our results also detail the impact of the system architecture selection, and the benefits in enabling feedback about student emotions to instructors during Social VR learning sessions. Lastly, we show the benefits of integrating our model-based feedback control in maximizing IoT-based application performance while keeping the associated costs at a minimum level.","","978-1-7281-3236-5","10.1109/ICFC.2019.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8821977","IoT-based-Application,-Cloud/Fog-System-Architecture,-Model-based-Resource-Management,-IoT-Data-Processing/-Visualization,-Social-Virtual-Reality","Cloud computing;Data visualization;Quality of experience;Systems architecture;Real-time systems;Electroencephalography;Quality of service","cloud computing;computer aided instruction;feedback;human computer interaction;Internet of Things;queueing theory;resource allocation;virtual reality","cost-performance trade-offs;IoT data processing;social VRLEs;cost-aware adaptive control rules;edge-cloud architectures;model-based feedback control;social virtual reality;large-scale sensor data;data visualization;virtual reality-based learning environments;Internet-of-Things-based application design;fog computing;user emotional data;brain sensors;system architecture selection;student emotions;model-based resource management;analytical queuing model","","4","","18","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are also three basic processing paradigms today that lend themselves to IoT data processing: stream and batch processing as well as serverless functions. Where to place which part of the data processing and which processing paradigm to choose, however, is often unclear. In this paper, we give an overview of all three paradigms as well as different data processing use-cases.

Fog computing is promising to lower communication delay and offload network traffic with the scale of big data increasing in large-scale IoT application, which brings micro-data centers to the network edge, enabling the network edge to perceive, process, storage and calculate the massive data, reducing the amount of transferred data. However, numerous fog nodes at the network edge face an external attack resulting in serious security threats arising from the trusting relationship vulnerability because of the lack of the consideration of the properties of the fog computing system.

To this end, we present a Kubernetes-based scalable fog computing platform (KFIML), integrating big data streaming processing with machine learning (ML)-based applications. We also provide a comprehensive IoT data processing workflow, including data access and transfer, big data processing, online ML, long-term storage, and monitoring. The platform is feasibly validated on a clustered testbed, which comprises a master node, IoT broker servers, worker nodes, and a local database server. By leveraging the lightweight orchestration system, namely Kubernetes, we can readily scale and manage containerized software frameworks on our testbed. The big data processing layer utilizes the advanced data flow frameworks such as Apache Flink, to support both streaming processing and statistical analysis with low latency. In addition, the specified long short-term memory (LSTM)-based ML pipelines are employed on the online ML layer, to enable the real-time predictive analysis of IoT data streams. The experiments on a real-world smart grid use case demonstrate that the container-based KFIML platform can be well-scaled with Kubernetes to efficiently perform big data processing increased onsite IoT data streams with lower latency and conduct ML-based applications.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3168085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9758947","Big data processing;fog computing;Internet of Things (IoT);Kubernetes;online machine learning (ML);predictive analysis","Internet of Things;Big Data;Edge computing;Real-time systems;Distributed databases;Sparks;Computer architecture","Big Data;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);smart power grids;statistical analysis","iot platform;online machine learning;massive onsite data;onsite IoT data streams;scalable computing platform;processing IoT data streams;Kubernetes-based scalable fog computing platform;machine learning-based applications;comprehensive IoT data processing workflow;data access;IoT broker servers;big data processing layer;advanced data flow frameworks;streaming processing;short-term memory-based ML pipelines;online ML layer;container-based KFIML;ML-based applications","","5","","39","IEEE","18 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To maintain a canonical state of blockchain data record, proof-of-work based consensus protocols provide the nodes, referred to as miners, in the network with incentives for confirming new block of transactions through a process of “block mining” by solving a cryptographic puzzle. Under the circumstance of limited local computing resources, e.g., mobile devices, it is natural for rational miners, i.e., consensus nodes, to offload computational tasks for proof of work to the cloud/fog computing servers. Therefore, we focus on the trading between the cloud/fog computing service provider and miners, and propose an auction-based market model for efficient computing resource allocation. In particular, we consider a proof-of-work based blockchain network, which is constrained by the computing resource and deployed as an infrastructure for decentralized data management applications. Due to the competition among miners in the blockchain network, the allocative externalities are particularly taken into account when designing the auction mechanisms. Specifically, we consider two bidding schemes: the constant-demand scheme where each miner bids for a fixed quantity of resources, and the multi-demand scheme where the miners can submit their preferable demands and bids. For the constant-demand bidding scheme, we propose an auction mechanism that achieves optimal social welfare. In the multi-demand bidding scheme, the social welfare maximization problem is NP-hard. Therefore, we design an approximate algorithm which guarantees the truthfulness, individual rationality and computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations, we show that our proposed auction mechanisms with the two bidding schemes can efficiently maximize the social welfare of the blockchain network and provide effective strategies for the cloud/fog computing service provider.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2019.2900238","WASP/NTU M4082187(grant numbers:4080); Singapore MOE Tier 1(grant numbers:2017-T1-002-007 RG122/17); MOE Tier 2(grant numbers:MOE2014-T2-2-015 ARC4/15); Singapore(grant numbers:NRF2015-NRF-ISF001-2277); Singapore EMA Energy Resilience(grant numbers:NRF2017EWT-EP003-041); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8666727","Blockchain;auction;cloud/fog computing;social welfare;pricing;proof of work;game theory","Blockchain;Resource management;Protocols;Cryptography;Task analysis;Peer-to-peer computing;Approximation algorithms","cloud computing;computational complexity;cryptocurrencies;data mining;distributed databases;electronic commerce;mobile computing;resource allocation;tendering","resource allocation;cloud/fog computing;decentralized secure data management platform;multidemand bidding scheme;constant-demand bidding scheme;decentralized data management applications;auction-based market model;block mining;proof-of-work based consensus protocols;public blockchain networks;auction mechanism","","144","","43","IEEE","13 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To achieve both flexibility and efficiency, we propose a data-centric programming model called Fog Function and also introduce its underlying orchestration mechanism that leverages three types of contexts: data context, system context, and usage context. Moreover, we showcase a concrete use case for smart parking where Fog Function allows service developers to easily model their service logic with reduced learning efforts compared to a static service topology. Our performance evaluation results show that the Fog Function can be scaled to hundreds of fog nodes.

These objects, or things, generate a massive amount of data that require powerful analytics approaches and data storage platforms - this is where cloud computing may well come into play. The classic cloud computing paradigm, however, faces several serious issues, due to centralization, such as low performance, latency issues, security issues, bandwidth obstacle, etc.. The Fog (Edge) computing paradigm has been proposed to improve the performance and to address other weaknesses, by providing IoT data processing and storage capabilities locally at the edges (IoT devices), instead of sending all the data to the centralized cloud. Whether in cloud or in fog computing, with billions of devices and a huge number of simultaneous requests, managing limited resources becomes essential. One of the important steps in resource management is task scheduling. In this paper, we consider task scheduling in a cloud-fog computing platform, we propose a multi-agent based model that aims at serving the most important task first, taking into consideration the task priority, its wait time, its status and the resources required to complete it successfully. Furthermore, in the scheduling process, we first propose an update to the priority value of the task, while taking into consideration its dependencies to other tasks and their priorities. Simulation results show that our proposed model can lead to better resource utilization and improve performance.","","978-1-7281-4821-2","10.1109/ICIoT48696.2020.9089625","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089625","Internet of things;cloud computing;fog computing;Task Scheduling model;Priority;multi-agent","Task analysis;Cloud computing;Processor scheduling;Dynamic scheduling;Heuristic algorithms;Edge computing","cloud computing;Internet of Things;multi-agent systems;scheduling","cloud computing paradigm;latency issues;security issues;fog computing paradigm;IoT devices;centralized cloud;task scheduling;cloud-fog computing platform;multiagent based model;task priority;scheduling process;Internet-of-Things","","14","","32","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the fact that decision support systems (DSS) combine data and knowledge from many domains and sources, analyze them, and store the results in the cloud to give the right users useful information to aid in decision-making, data is regarded as a core component in the design of DSS. Dealing with such enormous volumes of data results in increased mistakes, packet loss, and a high likelihood of data congestion, which is a drawback of traditional methods of storing massive amounts of data in the cloud. Therefore, before transferring data to decision support apps or sending it again to the cloud, processing, initializing, and preparing it in the fog computing environment is a necessary and appropriate option. An intelligent model for decision support applications in a fog computing environment was put out in this study. Expert review and focus group talks were employed as validation procedures in terms of relevancy and understanding of the proposed model. The observed results support the relevance and understanding of the proposed model's elements. A prototype based on the suggested model was developed to verify its validity, and its usability was then evaluated.

As the operational details are not transparent, the CSPs may be untrusted. They may steal the user data, tamper the data, remove the rarely accessed data or hide the data loss by duplicating the data. In such cases, data integrity fails and needs to be addressed. The emerging fog computing paradigm extends the cloud platform to provide services for IoT applications.

In IoT systems, if data management is entirely performed in the cloud, the system may not work correctly due to connectivity problems, which is common in some remote regions where the agribusiness thrives. A fog computing solution enables the IoT system to process data faster and deal with intermittent connectivity. However, a high number of packets sent from the fog to the cloud can cause link congestion with mostly useless data traffic. Dealing with fog data filtering is a challenge because it requires knowing which data is essential to send to the cloud. This paper proposes an approach to collect and store data in a smart agriculture environment and two different methods filtering data in the fog. We designed an experiment for each filtering method, using a real dataset containing temperature and humidity values. In both experiments, the fog filters the data using the k-Nearest-Neighbors (kNN) algorithm, which classifies data into categories according to their value ranges. In the first experiment, the fog classifies the data and generates an output of the number of data categories. In the second experiment, data is classified and also compressed based on the previously obtained categories using the runlength encoding (RLE) technique to preserve the data time series nature. Our results show that data filtering reduces the amount of data sent by the fog to the cloud.","","978-1-7281-8783-9","10.1109/MetroAgriFor50201.2020.9277661","European Commission; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9277661","smart agriculture;fog computing;Internet of things;data filtering;machine learning","Agriculture;Cloud computing;Sensors;Humidity;Edge computing;Training;Temperature distribution","agriculture;data compression;data mining;distributed processing;Internet of Things;nearest neighbour methods;pattern classification;runlength codes;time series","useless data traffic;fog data filtering;smart agriculture environment;filtering method;humidity values;k-nearest-neighbors algorithm;data time series;data filter;IoT smart agriculture;agricultural yield;IoT system;data management;connectivity problems;fog computing solution;intermittent connectivity;data filtering;runlength encoding","","9","","17","IEEE","8 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indeed, cloud capabilities of processing, networking, and storage are overwhelming properties that make it outperform classical solutions for decades when it comes to healthcare applications. Nevertheless, this architecture could not keep up with the ever-growing amount of biomedical data. One of the main drawbacks of cloud architecture is the large latency, which prevents it from delivering real-time alerts to save the patient's life in critical situations.

The selected research works of this survey are classified into four categories depending on their use case application. Furthermore, a comparison study helps extract relevant insights from several recent papers in the current literature to highlight their methodologies and purposes.

Data access security is improving day by day, despite the fact that data is kept remotely. The volume of data is likewise growing by the day. Data secrecy is maintained by securing data utilizing multiple behaviour parameters. The technique of encrypting and modifying messages in order to build data securely and to protect from attacks is known as cryptology (secret writing). NIST recommends AES as a symmetric encryption standard. AES has been shown to be a very secure, quick, and powerful encryption method. AES is widely utilized due to its high level of competency and ease of use. This paper introduce a system that will provide capabilities such as automatic text encryption and decryption.

In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving and compression-based data deduplication system under the fog-cloud network, which supports lossless deduplication of similar data in the encrypted domain. Specifically, we first use the generalized deduplication technique and cryptographic primitives to implement secure deduplication over similar data. Then, we devise a two-level deduplication protocol that can perform secure and efficient deduplication at distributed fog nodes and the cloud. The proposed system can not only resist brute-force and frequency analysis attacks but also ensure that only the data operator can capture the message equality information. We formally analyze the security of our design. Performance evaluations demonstrate that our proposed design is efficient in computing, storage, and communication.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2022.3179992","Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(grant numbers:CityU 11213920); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62102035,62072361,62172124); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2020NTST32); Shenzhen Basic Research Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20190806143011274); Shenzhen Colleges and Universities Stable Support Program(grant numbers:GXWD20201230155427003-20200822080602001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9787776","Brute-force attacks;fog-cloud network;frequency analysis;message equality information;similar data deduplication","Cloud computing;Cryptography;Sensors;Internet of Things;Data models;Costs;Computer science","cloud computing;cryptography;data compression;data privacy;Internet of Things;security of data;storage management","privacy-preserving deduplication;sensor compressed data;distributed fog computing;data management;network nodes;fog-cloud based systems;privacy-preserving data deduplication schemes;lossless deduplication;encrypted similar data;fog-cloud network;message equality information;brute-force;frequency analysis attacks;data deduplication system;generalized deduplication technique;secure deduplication;two-level deduplication protocol;efficient deduplication;distributed fog nodes;data operator","","1","","55","IEEE","3 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Filtering and processing data in-flight from edge to core presents an attractive possibility. By using resources within the network fabric itself, data can be reduced to a manageable level before reaching the core. Such drastic changes in data processing methodology do present new challenges and exacerbate old ones. Manual configuration and optimization at the fog scale is error prone. This paper discusses the Flange DSL and our in-flight processing framework InLocus, as a solution for driving fog configuration and management with declarative network topology assertions. By distributing configurable processing agents within the network fabric and modeling the network as a graph, the Flange compiler is capable of resolving terse, general flow assertions into network configurations at the device level. By chaining many such network functions together, the network topology can be transformed into a single virtual computation unit. Unlike previous approaches, the processing overlay topology is compiled automatically from the requirements of the task and the state of the underlying network. Each hop in the network provides an opportunity to operate on the data as it passes through, resulting in transformed data at the destination. The Flange language provides a propositional-logic based structure for selecting network components and asserting desired properties onto them. By using flow predicates, a program may define arbitrarily long chains of operations which are compiled into instructions to network agents that enact real behaviors on the network. The Flange compiler itself performs on moderately sized network graphs; compiling optimal placement schemes in under half a minute for graphs below 2,000 vertices when a solution exists. This performance scales to graphs in excess of 10,000 vertices, resolving in just over 3 minutes. The realization phase demonstrates faster performance; routing and computation results can be observed in the network in as little as one second over representative wide-area topologies. The fast iteration cycle provides developers with the ability to quickly identify processing or network issues in development or deployment.","","978-1-7281-3236-5","10.1109/ICFC.2019.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8822006","Network Management;Network topology;Sensor networks;Graphs and networks;Compilers","Flanges;Computational modeling;Network topology;Cloud computing;Edge computing;Computer architecture;Internet of Things","cloud computing;computational complexity;graph theory;optimisation;program compilers;program verification;telecommunication network topology","data management;data pipeline;core presents;attractive possibility;network fabric;data processing methodology;optimization;fog scale;Flange DSL;in-flight processing framework InLocus;fog configuration;declarative network topology assertions;configurable processing agents;Flange compiler;general flow assertions;network configurations;device level;network functions;single virtual computation unit;transformed data;Flange language;network components;asserting desired properties;network agents;moderately sized network graphs;compiling optimal placement schemes;computation results;wide-area topologies;network issues;multilayer stream orchestration;embedded sensor hardware;resulting deluge;measurement data","","2","","16","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, fog computing is introduced to provide location-sensitive and latency-aware local data management in vehicular crowdsensing, but it incurs new privacy concerns since drivers’ information could be disclosed. Although these messages are encrypted before transmission, malicious drivers can upload false reports to sabotage the systems, and filtering out false encrypted reports remains a challenging issue. To address the problems, we define a new security model and propose a privacy preserving traffic monitoring scheme. Specifically, we utilize short group signature to authenticate drivers in a conditionally anonymous way, adopt a range query technique to acquire driving information in a privacy-preserving way, and integrate it to the construction of a weighted proximity graph at each fog node through a WiFi challenge handshake to filter out false reports.

In this paper we aim to discuss the latest advances of corresponding legislation in the European Union and in the United States of America that affect these technology developments. First, we investigate IoT and Fog characteristics and identify different use cases of loT-Fog-Cloud environments that will be then used to discuss possible legal issues. We conclude the paper with role mappings for the identified cases, and by proposing recommendations on how to govern data management in these complex systems to ensure data protection as mandated by current legislations across these two regions. Our investigations imply that as we broaden the scope and complexity of the managed systems, the user control of the sensed private data weakens, and the responsibility of data protection are shifting towards fog, cloud and service providers.","2377-5750","978-1-7281-1644-0","10.1109/EMPDP.2019.8671620","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8671620","Internet of Things;Fog Computing;Cloud Computing;Data Protection;GDPR;U.S. privacy Rules","Cloud computing;Law;Internet of Things;Security;Data protection;Edge computing","cloud computing;Internet;Internet of Things;legislation","data management;end user;fog nodes;fog paradigm;loT-fog-cloud environments;situated Cloud nodes;connected devices;process data;cloud services;physical object;IoT applications;legal considerations;sensed private data weakens;managed systems;possible legal issues;possible security breach;complex systems;data protection","","2","","13","IEEE","21 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper provides a literature survey on various cloud services used in integration with IOT and a study about fog computing used in various application areas. Due to seamless data exchange between IOT devices and sensors, there was a need of platforms for data management, storage, and analysis.

Recently, fog is introduced to assist the cloud server by providing location-sensitive and latency-aware local data management. However, interaction between users and server without appropriate sanitation puts serious security threats to user' privacy (e.g., data content and preference). While existing work already has a wide range of privacy-preserving schemes, they hardly consider collusion attacks (CAs) between the server and users, let alone CAs between fog nodes and users. To solve this problem, we first define four specific CAs in fog-assisted crowdsensing and propose a novel privacy-preserving data reporting and requesting (PARE) scheme with collusion resistance. PARE is constructed by leveraging one-way hash chains, marked mix-nets, and grouping-based secure searchable encryption to securely collect users' reports and respond to users' requests under CAs. Then, we consider one extreme scenario and provide a solution by introducing a role of sentry reporter while reducing computational costs and communication overhead. Thorough security and privacy analysis shows that PARE is secure and collusion resistant and we also quantitatively measure privacy with mutual information. Extensive performance evaluation results indicate that PARE is lightweight with respect to computational cost and communication overhead. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one that gives four formal definitions of CAs in fog-assisted crowdsensing and aim to defend them at the same time.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2902459","China National Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2016YFB0800301); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872041,61871037); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8656533","Collusion attacks (CAs);crowdsensing;fog computing;mix-net;secure searchable encryption","Servers;Cloud computing;Privacy;Cryptography;Internet of Things;Data privacy","cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;mobile computing;sensor fusion","collusion resistance;smart mobile devices;cloud server;location-sensitive;latency-aware local data management;serious security threats;user privacy;privacy-preserving schemes;collusion attacks;fog nodes;grouping-based secure searchable encryption;sentry reporter;computational cost;privacy analysis;PARE scheme;secure fog-assisted crowdsensing;privacy-preserving data reporting-requesting;one-way hash chains;marked mix-nets;communication overhead","","23","","55","IEEE","1 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To cope with those constraints, Edge Computing (EC) is emerging as an innovative computing paradigm that leverages Cloud computing and brings it closer to the customer. “EC” refers to transferring computing power and intelligence from the central Cloud to the network’s Edge. With that, EC promotes the idea of processing and caching data at the Edge, thus reducing network congestion and latency. This paper presents a detailed, thorough, and well-structured assessment of Edge Computing and its enabling technologies. Initially, we start by defining EC from the ground up, outlining its architectures and evolution from Cloudlets to Multi-Access Edge Computing. Next, we survey recent studies on the main cornerstones of an EC system, including resource management, computation offloading, data management, network management, etc. Besides, we emphasized EC technology enablers, starting with Edge Intelligence, the branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that integrates AI models at resource-constrained edge nodes with significant heterogeneity and mobility. Then, moving on to 5G and its empowering technologies, we explored how EC and 5G complement each other. After that, we studied virtualization and containerization as promising hosting runtime for edge applications. Further to that, we delineated a variety of EC use-case scenarios, e.g., smart cities, e-Health, military applications, etc. Finally, we concluded our survey by highlighting the role of EC integration with future concerns regarding green energy and standardization.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3183634","National Academy of Sciences (NAS)/United States AID (USAID) under the PEER Cycle 5 Project(grant numbers:5-398); Towards Smart Microgrid: Renewable Energy Integration Into Smart Buildings; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9797685","Edge computing;cloud computing;fog computing;multi-access edge computing;edge intelligence;5G;containerization","Edge computing;Cloud computing;Quality of service;5G mobile communication;Internet of Things;Terminology","artificial intelligence;cache storage;cloud computing;Internet of Things;mobile computing;quality of service","Edge Computing technology enablers;systematic lecture study;increasing stringent QoS constraints;smart cities;rapidly increasing number;core network;innovative computing paradigm;leverages Cloud computing;computing power;central Cloud;caching data;network congestion;MultiAccess Edge Computing;survey recent studies;computation offloading;data management;network management;EC technology enablers;Edge Intelligence;resource-constrained edge nodes;empowering technologies;edge applications","","5","","373","CCBY","16 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, several conventional machine learning models have gained popularity in providing precise prediction of heart diseases by taking into account the underlying conditions of patients. The drawbacks associated with these methods are a lack of generalization and the convergence rate of these methods being much slower. As the healthcare data associated with these systems scale up leading to healthcare big data issues, a Cloud-Fog computing-based paradigm is necessary to facilitate low-latency and energy-efficient computation of the healthcare data. In this paper, a DeepMist framework is suggested which exploits Deep Learning models operating over Mist Computing infrastructure to leverage fast predictive convergence, low-latency, and energy efficiency for smart healthcare systems. We exploit the Deep Q Network (DQN) algorithm for building the prediction model for identifying heart diseases over the Mist computing layer. Different performance evaluation metrics, like precision, recall, f-measure, accuracy, energy consumption, and delay, are used to assess the proposed DeepMist framework. It provided an overall prediction accuracy of 97.6714% and loss value of 0.3841, along with energy consumption and delay of 32.1002 mJ and 2.8002 ms respectively. To validate the efficacy of DeepMist, we compare its outcomes over the heart disease dataset in convergence with other benchmark models like Q-Reinforcement Learning (QRL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms and observe that the proposed scheme outperforms all others.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3266374","Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University Researchers(grant numbers:PNURSP2023R195); Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10098739","Deep learning;mist computing;heart disease prediction;performance evaluation;latency;energy efficiency","Medical services;Computational modeling;Deep learning;Cloud computing;Data models;Edge computing;Monitoring","Big Data;cardiology;cloud computing;convergence;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;edge computing;energy conservation;energy consumption;health care;medical diagnostic computing;medical information systems;patient diagnosis;power aware computing","cardiac patients;cloud-fog computing;convergence rate;deep learning;deep Q network algorithm;DeepMist;DQN;energy consumption;energy efficiency;energy-efficient computation;f-measure;health care Big Data management;health care providers;heart disease dataset;machine learning;mist computing infrastructure;performance evaluation metrics;prediction accuracy;predictive convergence;smart health care systems;systems scale","","","","46","CCBYNCND","11 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
